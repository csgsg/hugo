The CSGSG serves as the assembly of all graduate students in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Virginia. All graduate students, Masterâ€™s and PhD, within the department of computer science or in the computer engineering program are automatically members of the CSGSG.

**What we do?**

The goals of the CSGSG are to represent the CS/CPE graduate student body as well as serve as a mechanism for students to organize events including orientations, tea time, reading groups, and external events like hiking and picnics. It has allowed graduate students to have a say in everything from our cubicle furniture and the price of printing (free) to qualification exams, just to name a few.

**Steering Committee:**

The Steering Committee consists of a Faculty Advisor and 3-4 graduate students as officers. The CSGSG Steering Comittee is usually the line of communication between the students and the department. We also organize various social/academic events and represent the department in other student orgnizations. 

**Ombudsman:**

It is also important that all students are aware of the Ombudsman. The Ombudsman is a member of the CS faculty that helps students with issues that they may have with faculty or administration. Conversations with them are kept confidential, so if you have any concerns or difficulties that you don't feel comfortable going to your advisor with, contact the Ombudsman or any of your CSGSG officers. The current Ombudsman is [Professor Gabriel Robbins](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/).
