*Project Title:* Vibration Intelligence in Cyber-Physical systems
*Project Description:*  All human activity causes vibration. Everything also vibrates at its natural frequency all the time. With AI technology, we can understand and utilize the features (amplitude, frequency, etc.) and phenomena (resonance, dispersion, doppler effect, etc.) of vibration to help human in their daily lives. Overall, vibration intelligence can be applied in many areas, such as smart homes, smart health, wearable interfaces, robotics, and security.
