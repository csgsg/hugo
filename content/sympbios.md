In natural language processing, existing methods usually provide important features which are words or phrases selected from an input text as an explanation, but ignore the interactions between them. It poses challenges for humans to interpret an explanation and connect it to model prediction. In this work, we aim to generate hierarchical explanations on text classification by detecting feature interactions. Such explanations visualize how words and phrases are combined at different levels of the hierarchy, which can help users understand the decision-making of black-box models. The proposed method will be applied to three neural text classifiers (LSTM, CNN, and BERT) on two benchmark datasets. Both automatic and human evaluations will be adopted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method in providing explanations that are faithful to models and interpretable to humans.'

    project_desc = 'When working with autonomous robotics systems, it remains difficult to develop a set of tests that is varied enough to expose distinct faults yet of reasonable size for practical execution. Of particular interest are two categories of faults: those arising from unreliable sensor readings and those caused by the planning algorithm not accurately capturing the hardware's capabilities. Because such systems operate in the physical world, the input space is continuous and thus un-enumerable. Even when discretizing the space based on practical sensor limitations, the input space is too large to explore exhaustively due to exponential blowup when considering the time dimension. Further, not all sensor sequences are plausible due to physical constraints and given a sensor sequence it can be difficult or impossible to exhibit an environment that leads to that sequence.

We propose a framework in the vein of software fuzzing to guide test selection and ordering to quickly explore sets of test environments for robot navigation systems. By correlating world features with test outcomes, the system can quickly determine before execution which tests are more likely to yield novel behaviors. Similarly, online sensor observations can be tracked against previous runs to determine mid-test if the run is novel and abort if not. Combined, these factors allow for a substantial reduction in the total time needed to produce meaningful tests that explore varied robot behaviors.'

    project_desc = 'While executing nominal tests on mobile robots is required for their validation, such tests may overlook faults that arise under trajectories that accentuate certain aspects of the robot's behavior. Uncovering such stressful trajectories is challenging as the input space for these systems, as they move, is extremely large, and the relation between a planned trajectory and its potential to induce stress can be subtle. To address this challenge we propose a framework that 1) integrates kinematic and dynamic physical models of the robot into the automated trajectory generation in order to generate valid trajectories, and 2) incorporates a parameterizable scoring model to efficiently generate physically valid yet stressful trajectories for a broad range of mobile robots. We evaluate our approach on four variants of a state-of-the-art quadrotor in a racing simulator. We find that, for non-trivial length trajectories, the incorporation of the kinematic and dynamic model is crucial to generate any valid trajectory, and that the approach with the best hand-crafted scoring model and with a trained scoring model can cause on average a 55.9% and 41.3% more stress than a random selection among valid trajectories. A follow-up study shows that the approach was able to induce similar stress on a deployed commercial quadrotor, with trajectories that deviated up to 6m from the intended ones.'

    project_desc = 'Predictive models of DNA epigenetic state such as transcription factor binding are essential for understanding regulatory processes and developing gene therapies. It is known that the 3D genome, or spatial structure of DNA, is highly influential in the epigenetic state. Deep neural networks have achieved state of the art performance on epigenetic state prediction by using short windows of DNA sequences independently. These methods, however, ignore the long-range dependencies when predicting the epigenetic states because modeling the 3D genome is challenging. In this work, we introduce ChromeGCN, a graph convolutional network for epigenetic state prediction by fusing both local sequence and long-range 3D genome information. By incorporating the 3D genome, we relax the i.i.d. assumption of local windows for a better representation of DNA. ChromeGCN explicitly incorporates known long-range interactions into the modeling, allowing us to identify and interpret those important long-range dependencies in influencing epigenetic states. We show experimentally that by fusing sequential and 3D genome data using ChromeGCN, we get a significant improvement over the state-ofthe-art deep learning methods as indicated by three metrics. Importantly, we show that ChromeGCN is particularly useful for identifying epigenetic effects in those DNA windows that have a high degree of interactions with other DNA windows.'

However, the field is still lacking cost-effective methods for reasoning about their behavior. In this work, we seek to expand the applicability and scalability of existing DNN verification techniques through DNN refactoring. A DNN refactoring is defined by both an architecture transformation and a strategy for distilling behavior from the original to the transformed network. Unlike traditional code refactoring, DNN refactoring does not guarantee functional equivalence between the original and transformed models, but aims to preserve the behavior of the original network on a test set while producing a simpler network that is amenable to more efficient property verification. We present an automated framework for DNN refactoring, and demonstrate its potential effectiveness on real-world models.'

The stormwater system and the control scenarios are simulated using the United States Environmental Protection Agency Storm Water Management Model (SWMM5). This project uses data-driven model-predictive control (MPC) for stormwater flood management. Building physics-based models for stormwater management is cost and time prohibitive. Consequently, we utilize unstructured state-space models for system identification and predictive control implementation. We demonstrate our results using a real stormwater network configuration from the Norfolk, VA region. Our results indicate that MPC outperforming rule-based strategies by 30−60%to minimize flooding across a node junction and a storage unit.'

    project_desc = 'Individual treatment effects (ITE) learning is a fundamental problem in causality learning, but the effectiveness of most existing methods is often limited due to the existence of hidden confounders - the unobserved variables that affect both the treatment and the outcome. Recent studies have shown that the auxiliary relational information among data can be utilized to mitigate the confounding bias. However, these works assume that the observational data and the relations among them are static, while in reality, both of them will continuously evolve over time and we refer to such data as time-evolving networked observational data. In this paper, we make an initial investigation of ITE estimation on such data. The problem remains a daunting task due to the following challenges: (1) modeling the evolution patterns of time- evolving networked observational data; (2) controlling the hidden confounders with current data and historical information; (3) alleviating the discrepancy between control group and treated group. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel ITE learning framework Dynamic Networked Observational Data Deconfounder (DNDC)which aims to learn the representations of hidden confounders over time by leveraging both current networked observational data and historical information that compresses previous hidden confounders and treatment assignment. Additionally, a novel adversarial learning based representation balancing method is incorporated toward unbiased ITE estimation. Experiment results on semi-synthetic datasets validate the effectiveness of our method measured against state-of-the-art baselines.'

    project_desc = 'The problem of learning to price is ubiquitous in the widely spreading e-commerce today. Previous work show that when we do not have prior knowledge about the buyer, the seller can effectively learn the optimal price from the revealed preferences from the buyer.  But they assume that the preferences must be honest.  However, the buyer has incentive to manipulate the learning mechanism.  This paper studies the problem of learning to price against a strategic buyer. We show that in the same setting, if the buyer is strategic, then the learning algorithm will perform exactly the same as a direct revelation pricing mechanism that simply asks the buyer about his value function and then computes the optimal price for that value function.  A key algorithmic problem for pricing against unknown strategic buyers is the requirement of reasoning over a vast space of actions. To address this challenge, we introduce the notion of permutation stability, which means the buyer cannot obtain a smaller accumulated payment by simply permuting his purchase responses during the seller’s process of learning to price. Our main insight is that permutation stable response can ensure the strategic buyer is consistently best responding according to a concave value function. We prove that the optimal permutation stable response is also the optimal robust and oblivious manipulation for the buyer. By leveraging permutation stability, we efficiently reduce the hard multi-rounds dynamic pricing game to the simple single-round value-elicitation pricing game. We provide a fairly complete characterization of optimal manipulations for the buyer in this domain.  This shows that without additional prior knowledge, learning is not more powerful than standard mechanism design, and any effective learning mechanism must incorporate additional prior information in order todo better than mechanism design.'

    project_desc = 'Persistent memory (PM) technologies, such as Intel’s Optane DC persistent memory, deliver high performance, byte-addressability, and persistence, allowing programs to directly manipulate persistent data in memory without any OS intermediaries. An important requirement of these programs is that persistent data must remain consistent across a failure, which we refer to as the crash consistency guarantee. 

However, maintaining crash consistency is not trivial. We identify that a consistent recovery critically depends not only on the execution before the failure, but also on the recovery and resumption after failure. We refer to these stages as the pre- and post-failure execution stages. In order to holistically detect crash consistency bugs, we categorize the underlying causes behind inconsistent recovery due to incorrect interactions between the pre- and post-failure execution. First, a program is not crash-consistent if the post-failure stage reads from locations that are not guaranteed to be persisted in all possible access interleavings during the pre-failure stage — a type of programming error that leads to a race that we refer to as a cross-failure race. Second, a program is not crash-consistent if the post-failure stage reads persistent data that has been left semantically inconsistent during the pre-failure stage, such as a stale log or uncommitted data. We refer to this type of bugs as a cross-failure semantic bug. Together, they form the cross-failure bugs in PM programs. In this work, we provide XFDetector, a tool that detects cross-failure bugs by automatically injecting failures into the pre-failure execution, and checking for cross-failure races and semantic bugs in the post-failure continuation. XFDetector has detected four new bugs in three pieces of PM software: one of PMDK’s examples, a PM-optimized Redis database, and a PMDK library function.'

This approach is surprisingly simple and effective and surpasses or is comparable with the best methods proposed in the recent literature across all the standard benchmarks for image classification. Notably, we obtain 94.91% accuracy on CIFAR-10 using only 4,000 labeled samples, and 88.56% top-5 accuracy on Imagenet-ILSVRC using 128,000 labeled samples.

Our goal is to understand how people of different socioeconomic status respond in such situations, how they choose to follow the evacuation process, how the damages to the transportation network caused by the hurricane impact the evacuation routing process, how the evacuees communicate etc. In our simulations, we model each evacuee as a single agent and use demographic data to model their behavior. To model the transportation network, we use a network of queues representation. Observations from these simulations will help us better prepare for future hurricanes and minimize the loss of lives.'

But consider what human hands can sense and manipulate in the real world, and how colorful these interactions are, current 3D touch experience in VR definitely cannot satisfy the growing user’s demand for a high-efficiency and dexterous interaction. Especially in some professional areas like 3D sketching, research already showed that drawing without physical surface in VR is really problematic for designers. To go beyond 3D sketching, and get more insights into 3D touching, it is necessary to compare touch gesture performance on different tasks with different types of haptic feedback in VR, includes no physical object to rely on, virtual haptic feedback and physical objects. And eventually, figure out which type of haptic feedback works best in VR.'

These systems are often concurrent, their traces are time-series data, and their behavior is influenced by stochastic forces such as battery drain or weather conditions. By design they are not necessarily accessible by a human user who can fully observe, analyze, and debug through the traditional patch-test-repeat process. Moreover these stochastic forces may not be fully observable by a human user nor capturable by the system.
Existing debugging techniques diff test case results, compare execution paths, or model-check (or some combination thereof) to isolate faults. However, this is not sufficient in concurrent nondeterministic systems that are not fully observable, for example because a failure may be the product of several subroutines inconsistently contributing to a global state, race conditions between subroutines, or states that are not fully captured by system artifacts.
I am exploring how to adapt newer debugging techniques from the software engineering community such as decision tree algorithms, statistical analysis, and program spectrum analysis so that they can handle concurrent, partially observable systems whose behaviors have the propensity to be nondeterministic.'

    project_desc = 'Computer systems are increasingly bottlenecked by the costs of data movement between memory and processors, due to the ever-increasing amount of data (i.e., big data explosion). Many modern applications, such as database, graph processing, deep learning, and bioinformatics applications, are memory-intensive, i.e., require a few computations per memory access. Thus, data movement overhead dominates the execution time and energy consumption in data centers, as well as mobile and IoT devices.

Mitigating data movement costs requires computing as close to the memory cell as possible. A promising approach is to process data inside the memory (PIM). In-situ computing is one of the most aggressive forms of PIM that places processing elements in the row buffer, i.e., very close to where data are stored. Since the row buffer’s width is wide (e.g., 64 words), prior works’ processing units only support bitwise logic operations (e.g., AND, XOR, NAND) to limit the hardware overhead. Accordingly, they can benefit only a limited set of applications. Our goal in this project, Fulcrum, is to design a semi-general-purpose accelerator that benefits a wide range of key kernels of modern applications such as deep learning, recommender systems, natural language processing, and big data analytics. We showed that prior in-situ approaches that employ row-wide logic units require many row activations to emulate arithmetic operations, and the energy consumption and execution time of row activation nullifies the benefit of in-situ computing. According, we argued that a single-word light-weight ALUs (that has comparable hardware overhead to the row-wide logic units) outperforms row-wide logic units. However, to provide enough flexibility for supporting key kernels, we also need a control and access mechanism. The complex control and access mechanism of traditional processors are not practical for in-situ computing, as they impose significant hardware, execution time, and energy overhead. We traded off full-flexibility for less overhead and proposed a light-weight control and access mechanism that sequentially feeds data into the single-word ALU and enables operations with data dependencies and operations based on a predicate. We map and optimize important kernels from different domains (e.g., dense and sparse linear algebra, machine learning, deep learning, and database management system) to our simplified design and show that our design is flexible enough to support key kernels. Our evaluations show that Fulcrum outperforms a server-class GPU, NVIDIA P100, and delivers on average 70 (228) times speedup per memory stack and 97% energy reduction, compared to the GPU.'
