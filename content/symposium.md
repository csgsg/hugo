**Symposium Overview**  
As a result of the pandemic, CSGSG is hosting a CS Department Virtual Research Symposium on  June 5th. The symposium is meant to allow everyone to learn about each otherâ€™s research and boost morale. The symposium will feature faculty introduction talks and short student research presentations for each of the core CS research areas.


**Awards**  
Awards will be given to the top 2 best talks in each session. Student talks will be reviewed by a student review committee and by all who attended the talk using a 5 question survey. The students will be reviewed based on the following characteristics, using a score of 1-5 with 5 being the best:
- Understandability: Presentation is attainable for a general audience
- Clarity of Presentation: Structure and organization of talk and quality of presentation materials result in a clear, cohesive presentation
- Science Communication: Time management, speaker confidence, and communication ability
- Motivation & Importance: Speaker motivates clearly the novelty and importance of the research
- Question Session: Ability of speaker to handle question session  

Awardees will receive some nice UVA swag such as hot/cold drink container, stylus writing pen, tote or lunch cooler, etc. The swag will be mailed to our winners.


## Schedule

Student talks are 5 minutes with 5 minutes for questions, submitting speaker reviews and transitioning to the next speaker. Faculty talks will be 20-25 minutes with the remaining time left for questions.
