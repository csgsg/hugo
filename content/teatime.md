Tea time is a great chance to talk with other people in the department! We offer free food and drink every week. Please consider hosting tea time if you enjoy the event.

## Schedule

The tea time schedule is available on the front page: http://csgsg.org.

## How to host tea time
- Please contact Tea Time Czar if you volunteer to host tea time.
- You may order food and drinks by phone, the Internet or visiting the restaurants/stores in advance. You don't have to wait until Friday to place the food order. Food delivery service is recommended for saving your time.
- Please try to search coupons before you placing the order. We typically get at least 25% off on pizza orders, sometimes over 40% off. The extra large size and square cut are strong recommended.
- You may request some tableware (plates, cups, forks and napkins) for free in your food order message. Extra tea time supplies are stored in a cabinet in Rice 228.
- Ask your buddy to help move the food to the tea time location and do the cleaning after tea time.
- You are eligible to have a temporary T4 parking permit if the food delivery service is not available and you would have to pick up from the restaurants/stores. (ask Weilin for the permit)

## How to get reimbursed

- The current teatime budget is only $250. Please try your best to get a good deal on food orders.
- ~~However, we typically spend $150 - $200 for the summer weeks due to fewer people in Rice.~~
- You may pay with your own credit card and get reimbursed later from the front office.
- Please print and fill [a reimbursement form](https://xuweilin.org/teatime/TeaTimeForm.pdf) and turn it in to the front office with the original receipts.
