## Order Food

- You may order food and drinks by phone, the Internet or visiting the restaurants/stores in advance. You don't have to wait until Friday to place the food order.
- Food delivery service is recommended for saving your time. You may request the delivery time as 2:15 pm, instead of 2:30 pm to avoid the trouble of late delivery.
- You can get a temporary parking permit from Christine if the food delivery service is not available and you would need to pick up from the restaurants/stores.
- You may request some tableware (plates, cups, forks and napkins) for free in your food order message. Extra tea time supplies are stored in a cabinet in Rice 228.
- Ask your buddy to help move the food to the tea time location and do the cleaning after tea time.

## Reimbursement

- The current teatime budget is $250.
- However, we typically spend $150 - $200 for the summer weeks due to fewer people in Rice.
- You may pay with your own credit card and get reimbursed later from the front office.
- Please request a reimbursement form at the front desk, fill the form and turn it in with the original receipts. 
- A reimbursement form template is kindly provided by Kevin Angstadt: [download here](https://xuweilin.org/teatime/TeaTimeForm.pdf)
